# Project Horizons
**Expanding the horizons of Minecraft's progression post-End.** 
---
Made using a custom datapack, resourcepack, and plugins.

All parts of the project have been created by me, or are being supplimented by plugins that work out-the-box to do what I need. Currently, those plugins are:

- [InteractiveBooks](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/interactivebooks.45604/) (Not mine!)
- [Multiverse](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiverse-core.390/) (Not mine!)
- Project Horizons PLugin (Mine!)
